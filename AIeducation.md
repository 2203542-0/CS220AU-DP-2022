# AI and its impact on Education

Artifical Intelligence (AI) has evolved all over the world and especially in the field of education. In this video, we can see the potential AI has on education. In schools all over China, Teachers are using AI in a way that has never been seen before. Students are equipped with headbands, the headbands display different colors based on the students EEG readings which measures their levels of concentration . Red means you’re deeply focused, Blue means you’re distracted, and this information is then transimiited to the parents in to know the performance eof their children. 

EEG is often used by doctors in hospitals or laboratories, therefore Theodore Zanto, a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco, was astonished to learn that it is utilized in classrooms with children in order to improve their performance.

Despite the potential for false readings, the teachers claimed that the headbands have compelled students to become more disciplined and pay more attention in class, which has caused them to work harder and achieve higher grades.
