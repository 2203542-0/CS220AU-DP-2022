# AI and Art

Refik Anadol one of the worldâ€™s best artists has made his creations using AI. His work is made up of millions of tiny pieces and every single little point represents a piece of data that has been fed through a neural network to show his vision of our future. He uses machine intelligence and algorithms to create visualizations what he calls data sculptures. 

One of the examples of his creation is Machine Hallucinations where he added 10 million images of New york online and managed to erase humans from the images and focused on the buildings, nature and environment which formed a collective memory of New York.

When the machine sees multiple photos of the Statue of Liberty taken from slightly different angles the algorithm interpolates information to help create a moving, shifting image that represents the entire life cycle of the statue of liberty. 

Based on the principal of machine intelligence and data driven language Refik Anadol creates abstarct and dream like environments as a form of art that has never been seen before.
